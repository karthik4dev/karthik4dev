After each operation print the amount left in the Bank account. If the debit amount is greater than current balance print "Insufficient Funds"(without quotes) and the operation is skipped.



Problem Constraints

1 <= N, X <= 1011
1 <= Number of operations <= 105



Input Format

First line contains a single integer N denoting the balance in bank account.

Second line contains a single integer M denoting the number of operations.

Each of next M lines contains two space separated integers Type and Amount(X).

If Type == 1, Perform ADD operation.
If Type == 2, Perform SUBTRACT operation.


Output Format

Print Amount in the bank balance after each operation on a new line.



Example Input

1000
3
1 500
2 1400
2 500


Example Output

        if oper == 1:
            amt+=ad
            print(amt)
        elif oper == 2 and ad<amt:
            amt-=ad
            print(amt)
